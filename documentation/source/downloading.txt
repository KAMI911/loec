Downloading and installing
==========================

EuroOffice Extension Creator development is managed through Launchpad at
https://launchpad.net/eoec/. Stable releases are available at
https://launchpad.net/eoec/+download and the live source code can be
checked out from the `Bazaar <http://bazaar-vcs.org/>`_ repository 
``lp:eoec``.

Using Bazaar is surprisingly simple.
Installation instructions and downloads for every platform
are at http://doc.bazaar-vcs.org/latest/en/mini-tutorial/index.html#installation.
Once it is installed, just execute ::

	bzr branch lp:eoec

and the latest source code will be downloaded. Now you can edit this source code
and make commits, but take note that these commits are only made to your local
repository. When you have created something magnificent, you can upload it to
Launchpad, and the EuroOffice Extension Creator maintainers can then take a look
and accept the changes. This process is slightly more complicated than checking
out, but it is well described at https://help.launchpad.net/Code/UploadingABranch.

Now that the source code is on your computer you can start using EuroOffice
Extension Creator, so on to the next section!

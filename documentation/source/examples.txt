Example extensions
==================================

Star Maker
----------

Star Maker is a basic OpenOffice.org Draw extension that draws a star based on input from a dialog.

This is a good starter example and it is thoroughly documented in :ref:`star-maker-detailed`.
There is also a `screencast <http://www.multiracio.com/eurooffice/news/eurooffice-extension-creator-screencast>`_
that uses this example to demonstrate EOEC development.

Barcode
-------

This example is basically the same as Star Maker, but instead of stars it draws barcodes. Since
there is a much larger demand for barcodes, this extension has become practically useful and
with the help of many users it has been translated to numerous languages and many barcode types
have been added.

It is now a good example of a full-fledged extension created with EOEC.

Merriam-Webster Dictionary
--------------------------

*Merriam-Webster is a trademark of Merriam-Webster Incorporated.
This example is just for developers and should not be released separately.*

Merriam-Webster Dictionary is an OpenOffice.org Writer extension that integrates an
`online thesaurus <http://www.merriam-webster.com/>`_. It is an example of an interactive dialog
where words are looked up based on selection from a listbox and online connectivity. Python
extensions in OpenOffice.org have the full power of Python available to them, so web pages
can be fetched and processed with ease. For processing web pages this example uses `Beautiful
Soup <http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/>`_, a very convenient and reliable pure-Python
HTML parser.

Lookup
------

Lookup is a very simple extension that looks up the selected text (in OpenOffice.org Writer) on
Google in the user's default browser. To make it a bit more interesting it illustrates how
a keyboard shortcut can be assigned to a menu item.

Shuffle
-------

Shuffle is an OpenOffice.org Calc example and illustrates basic cell access. It shuffles the
rows of the current selection.

Sharpen
-------

Sharpen is an OpenOffice.org Draw extension. It illustrates context-menu integration,
the integration of a binary module (`PIL <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/>`_) in
a multiplatform way and access to Draw objects. It uses :func:`util.draw.embed` to
insert the sharpened image back to OpenOffice.org.
